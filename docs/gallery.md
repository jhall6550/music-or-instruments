Add images or short audio clips to show musical instruments, album art, or band photos.

Example images (replace with your uploads):

- ![Album art example](../assets/images/album-art.jpg)
- ![Live performance example](../assets/images/live.jpg)

Example audio embed (after you upload sample.mp3 to docs/assets/audio/):
<audio controls>
  <source src="assets/audio/sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

Tip: keep audio files short to keep your repo small.
