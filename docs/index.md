# Welcome to Music Explorations

This site is a small, public informational site about music built with MkDocs (Python) and published to GitHub Pages. You can edit all pages directly in the GitHub web editor on your Chromebook — no local Python install needed.

What you can explore here:
- Pages about genres (rock, jazz) with short descriptions and images.
- A page about instruments and how they work.
- An interactive audio visualizer (runs in the browser using p5.js).
- A gallery with images and an example audio clip.

Quick tips
- To add an image, upload it to `docs/assets/images/` and reference it with a relative link like `assets/images/your-image.jpg`.
- To add a short audio clip, upload it to `docs/assets/audio/sample.mp3` (keep clips small, < 2–3 MB).
- Edit any page in the `docs/` folder and commit to the `main` branch — the workflow will rebuild & publish.

Try the visualizer
- Go to the "Visualizer" page, upload a short MP3 to `docs/assets/audio/sample.mp3`, then press Play on that page to start the visualizer.

Enjoy — you can expand this site however you like: add pages, embed YouTube, or add small interactive sketches.
